# AI Engineering Lifecycle on LangSmith Platform

Enterprise workshop series teaching the complete AI engineering lifecycle using LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith—centered around building a customer support agent for a fictional online technology e-commerce store called TechHub.

## What You'll Build

A customer support agent system featuring:
- **Multi-agent architecture** with specialized Database and Documents agents coordinated by a Supervisor
- **Human-in-the-loop (HITL)** customer verification with LangGraph primitives
- **Evaluation-driven development** using offline evaluation to identify and fix bottlenecks
- **Production deployment** to LangSmith with online evaluation and data flywheels for continuous improvement

## Quick Setup

This workshop uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - a fast Python package installer and resolver. If you don't have it:

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then set up the workshop:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-agent-lifecycle-workshop.git
cd langsmith-agent-lifecycle-workshop

# Install dependencies (creates virtual environment automatically)
uv sync

# Configure API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys:
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
#   LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_...

# Build vectorstore (one-time setup, ~60 seconds)
uv run python data/data_generation/build_vectorstore.py

# Launch Jupyter
uv run jupyter lab
```

### Embedding Configuration (Optional)

By default, the vectorstore uses **HuggingFace embeddings** (local model, no API key required). If you're in an environment where downloading models from HuggingFace is restricted, you can use **OpenAI embeddings** instead:

```bash
# Add to your .env file:
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai

# Rebuild the vectorstore with OpenAI embeddings
uv run python data/data_generation/build_vectorstore.py
```

## Workshop Outline

This workshop consists of three modules that take you from manual tool calling to production deployment:

1. **Module 1: Agent Development** - Build from basics to multi-agent systems with HITL
2. **Module 2: Evaluation & Improvement** - Use eval-driven development to systematically improve agents
3. **Module 3: Deployment & Continuous Improvement** - Deploy to production and build a data flywheel

📚 To get started, see [workshop_modules/README.md](workshop_modules/README.md)

## Continuous Evaluation (CI/CD)

Every PR that touches agent-relevant code (`agents/`, `tools/`, `evaluators/`, `deployments/`, `evals/`, `config.py`) is automatically evaluated against the Module 2 baseline dataset — the same `correctness` and `total_tool_calls` evaluators from Module 2, wired into GitHub Actions as a merge-blocking regression test rather than something you have to remember to run by hand.

- **See it in code:** [`evals/run_ci_eval.py`](evals/run_ci_eval.py) and [`.github/workflows/eval-regression.yml`](.github/workflows/eval-regression.yml)
- **See it explained:** [`workshop_modules/module_3/section_3_cicd_regression_gate.ipynb`](workshop_modules/module_3/section_3_cicd_regression_gate.ipynb)
- **Demo it live:** run `./scripts/demo_ci_pr.sh` to open a throwaway PR that only touches `evals/DEMO_TRIGGER.md` — no real agent/eval code changes — so you can show the gate triggering and passing (or failing) an audience without needing a real code change every time. Close the PR without merging when you're done.
